In Emacs, displaying an image occupies one line regardless of its height. The movement over the image while navigating by lines can be quite frustrating.

Although [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/pixel-scroll.el][pixel-scroll]] and [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/pixel-scroll.el][iscroll]] have improved image movement to some extent.

I hope to move images in the same way as moving text, line by line.

So I created this package to horizontally slice the images referenced in the buffer into multiple images. In Emacs, only a portion of the original image is displayed on each line. Finally, the image can be moved line by line.

* Prerequisites

*[[https://imagemagick.org/][ImageMagick]]*

This cli tool can slice an image into multiple part.

** Install
+ clone the project in your own emacs configuration files directory, like:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone git@github.com:ginqi7/image-overlay.git ~/.emacs.d/lisp/image-overlay
#+END_SRC

+ add the path to 'load-path'
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/lisp/d/lisp/image-overlay"))
#+END_SRC

* Configuration
Here are a few variables that can be used for configuration:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'image-overlay)
#+end_src


* Features

- `image-overlay-mode` : Automatically find the image links in the buffer and render them for multi-line display.
- `Asynchronous` : Slicing image is Asynchronous.


** Supported Link Format
*** Org Link
- =[[url][tag]]=
- =[[url]]=
*** pure link
- =file:./hello.png=
- =http://image.png=

* Example

[[file:screencast.gif]]

* Disadvantages
- It will generates many temporary image files in the temporary system directory.
- When the URL link is too short, the image will be incomplete.
